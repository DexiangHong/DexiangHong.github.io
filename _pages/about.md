I am currently an AI Algorithm Engineer at Bytedance.Inc. I received my M.S. degree from the Department of Computer Science and Technology, University of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, advised by Prof. Guorong Li and Qingming Huang in July 2022. Before that, I received my B.S. degree from the Department of Computer Science and Technology, Hefei University of Technology in July, 2019.

Currently, my research interest includes topics on theoretical understandings for deep generative models and their applications, such as image generation, image editing, video generation.
